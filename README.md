Calculator Interface




A simple Python calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the TKinter module. This project demonstrates how to build an interactive application with Python.

Features

Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Clear and intuitive interface with buttons and display

Responsive input handling

Easy to extend with additional features

How It Works

Import the TKinter module to create the GUI.

Create the main window for the calculator.

Add buttons and a display for user input and results.

Connect buttons to functions that perform arithmetic operations.

Run the main loop to keep the application interactive.

Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Install TKinter if not already included:

pip install tk


Run the script:

python calculator.py

Usage Example

Click the number buttons to enter values.

Click an operator (+, -, *, /) to perform an operation.

Click = to see the result.

Click C to clear the display.

Optional: Add a screenshot or GIF of the interface to make it more visual:
